Birthay Card for my girlfriend, Amy Lightowlers.

This is just is just a bit of fun to make a birthday card for my girlfriend. She always love creativwe gifts so this year I thought I would use my new skill and make her a birthday page/card.

This will mainly use html and css but I will input some js also as I want to keep practicing this language.
